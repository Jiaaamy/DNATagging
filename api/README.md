There are 3 APIs currently supported:

* encode - convert an integer id into a bit pattern for DNATags
* decode - read before and after reaction images of a DNATag reporter ticket and return the encoded id
* get_raw_matrix - read the before and after reaction images of a DNATag reporter ticket and return the normalized signal decay matrix (used for debugging)
